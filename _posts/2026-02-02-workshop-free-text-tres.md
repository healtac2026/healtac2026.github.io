We are pleased to announce a **full-day workshop on Free-text healthcare data and Trusted Research Environments (TREs)** at HealTAC 2026.

Funded by **DARE UK**, the workshop will bring together project teams from **STAR-TRE**, **FORTRESS-TeHR**, and **TRExt**, alongside the **SAFETEXT** community working group, to explore next-generation capabilities for the safe and responsible use of de-identified and synthetic healthcare free-text data. The workshop will highlight emerging tools, evaluation practices, and governance considerations, and will provide an opportunity for community feedback and discussion of future collaboration.

The workshop is organised by **Franz Gruber** (University of Edinburgh), **Goran Nenadic** (University of Manchester), and **Yamiko Msosa** (King’s College London).

Further details are available on the [Workshops page](/workshops/).
